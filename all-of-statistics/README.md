A Concise Course in Statistical Inference

- Part I: **probability theory**
  - the formal language of uncertainty which is the basis of statistical inference. The basic problem that we study in probability is:
  - Given a data generating process, what are the properties of the outcomes?
- Part II: **statistical inference** and its close cousins, **data mining and machine learning**
  - The basic problem of statistical inference is the inverse of probability:
  - Given the outcomes, what can we say about the process that generated the data?
  - Prediction, classification, clustering, and estimation** are all special cases of statistical inference.
  - **Data analysis, machine learning and data mining** are various names given to the practice of statistical inference, depending on the context.
- Part III applies the ideas from Part II to specific problems such as **regression, graphical models, causation, density estimation, smoothing, classification, and simulation**.
  - Part III contains one more chapter on probability that covers **stochastic processes** including **Markov chains**.
