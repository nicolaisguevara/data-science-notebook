The caret package (short for classification and regression training) contains functions to streamline the model training process for complex regression and classification problems.

- `createDataPartition`
- `train`
- `trainControl`
- `confusionMatrix`

### `train`

- evaluate, using resampling, the effect of model tuning parameters on performance
- choose the "optimal" model across these parameters
- estimate model performance from a training set
